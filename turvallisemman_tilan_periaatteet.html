    <h1>Principles of a safer space</h1>
    <p>Respect the other person's personal physical and mental state. Respect the right to self-determination. Do not touch another without asking permission. Remember that you cannot know another person's boundaries without asking them. Ask for space for yourself as well, if necessary.</p>
    <p>Don't mock, sneer, belittle, push aside or embarrass anyone with your words, behavior or actions. Stop judging looks, gossiping and maintaining stereotypes.</p>
    <p>Don't make assumptions based on appearance or actions. Do not make assumptions about anyone's sexuality, gender, nationality, ethnicity, religion, values, socio-economic background, health or ability to function.</p>
    <p>Give space. Try to ensure that everyone has a chance to participate in the discussion. Don't belittle other people's opinions and speak up. Also respect the privacy of others and treat sensitive topics with respect.</p>
    <p>Listen and learn. Accept new topics, people and perspectives without prejudice. Treat every thing and situation that comes your way as an opportunity to learn something new and develop.</p>
    <p>Apologise if you have intentionally or unintentionally offended others.</p>
